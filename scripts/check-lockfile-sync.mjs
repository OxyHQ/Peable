#!/usr/bin/env bun

// Fail the build when bun.lock does not match the package.json files it describes.
//
// ## WHY NOT `--frozen-lockfile`
//
// It is the obvious gate and it fails OPEN. It exits 0 on a workspace package's
// own `version` bumped without regenerating the lockfile, and on a dependency
// range widened to something the lockfile does not record (^2.9.0 → >=2.9.0). It
// fails only when a range resolves to nothing at all — a resolution error, not a
// sync check. `ci.yml` runs it, and it would have caught neither shape.
//
// ## WHY TWO LAYERS AND NOT JUST THE INSTALL
//
// Installing and asking git whether bun.lock moved is the right primary check,
// and it is what this repository had — inline in `ci.yml`. It is NOT sufficient
// on its own, and the gap is the highest-value mode: **a plain `bun install`
// does not rewrite a workspace package's recorded `version`.** bun leaves the
// stale value in bun.lock and reports no changes, so `git diff --quiet` says
// clean and an install-only gate exits 0. `test-check-lockfile-sync.mjs` pins
// that with a fixture; it is the case that fails if layer 1 is ever dropped.
//
// So what bun.lock records per workspace is compared against the manifests
// directly, BEFORE any install. That layer is the only thing standing between a
// version bump and a release published from a state that was never committed.
//
// ## THE BUN PIN
//
// A lockfile written by a different bun can differ on formatting alone, so a
// difference this runtime caused must never be reported as the commit's. That
// makes `packageManager` load-bearing here, and it is also why this file asserts
// the OTHER pins agree with it: the version is a single fact spelled in more
// than one file, and the Dockerfile cannot read JSON in a `FROM` line. Before
// this check existed the agreement was maintained by a comment.
