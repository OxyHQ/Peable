# Run ONE migration phase as a one-shot ECS task and fail if it did not succeed.
#
# Usage: run-migration-task.sh <pre|post|all>
#
# In a script rather than inline YAML because the interesting part is the exit
# handling, and that is the part a reviewer must be able to read: an ECS task
# that fails is not an error from the AWS CLI's point of view — `run-task`
# returns 0 as soon as the task is ACCEPTED. A workflow that only checked the
# CLI's exit code would report a green deploy for a migration that threw, which
# is precisely the failure the phase split exists to prevent.
#
# Environment (set by the workflow):
#   CLUSTER, APP, PG_DATABASE     from the workflow's `env:` block
#   TASK_DEFINITION               the service's live task definition ARN
#   CONTAINER_NAME                the container to override within it
#   NETWORK_CONFIGURATION         the service's awsvpc config, as compact JSON
set -euo pipefail

# The three values `@oxy.so/db` accepts as a `run` (its MIGRATION_RUNS). `all` is
# the cutover escape hatch, not a normal release: it applies destructive
# migrations while the previous image is still serving, which is only safe when
# there is no previous image serving this schema.

# `bun` on the TypeScript SOURCE, not `node` on a compiled entrypoint. This

# `packages/backend/src/` and its CMD is `bun packages/backend/src/server.ts`,
# with `bun run build` used only as a type gate whose output is discarded. A
# `node dist/db/migrate.js` command here would fail with MODULE_NOT_FOUND.
#
# `--target-database` is the migrator's own guard: it refuses to run unless this
# name matches the database DATABASE_URL resolves to, so a task pointed at the
# wrong database fails instead of migrating it.
