/**
 * Reducing a provider payload to what this gateway may keep.
 *
 * A payment provider's webhook body is the richest personal-data object Peable
 * ever receives — billing address, email, phone, card brand and last four, a
 * network fingerprint, a device id, a three-D-Secure result — and none of it is
 * the gateway's to hold. `provider_events` is the one table a support query
 * looks at, so storing a payload whole would make every such query a
 * disclosure.
 *
 * ## An ALLOW-list, and it has to be
 *
 * A deny-list of known-sensitive keys is the intuitive design and the wrong one:
 * it is correct only until the provider adds a field, which they do without
 * telling anyone and which is exactly when a new sensitive field appears. The
 * allow-list fails the other way — a genuinely useful new field is dropped until
 * someone adds it here, which is a missing column in an operator view rather
 * than a disclosure.
 *
 * ## What survives, and why each one earns it
 *
 * Ids (to correlate), amounts and currencies (to reconcile), statuses and
 * outcome codes (to explain), timestamps (to order events). Between them they
 * answer every question an operator asks of a stored event. Anything else is
 * read live from the provider by a human with their own authorization, not from
 * a copy the gateway kept.
 *
 * Ported from Mercaria's `services/payments/redact.ts`, which this replaces as
 * the rail moves (ADR 0001). The allow-list gains the gateway's own correlation
 * keys — `peable_intent_id` is what `stripeProvider.createPayment` puts in
 * metadata, and an event whose payload dropped it could not be matched back to
 * an intent by anything but the object id.
 */

/**
 * Keys whose values are kept verbatim when they are scalars.
 *
 * Matched case-INSENSITIVELY and punctuation-insensitively against the key's own
 * name, so `paymentIntent`, `payment_intent` and `PaymentIntent` are one rule
 * rather than three — a provider's casing is their business and a rule that
 * depends on it is a rule with a silent hole.
